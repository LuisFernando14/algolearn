# Hello, I am Wilfrido and this is my repository algolearn.

# In this repository I will be posting some programming problems solved in java, c# or python. There are three categories: easy, medium and hard.

# Additionally, in every problem I submit, i will leave a link to an specific topic of software development. The reason of that is because sometimes we forget easy deatils of programming and once we remember, we can connect our current knowledge with the previous knowledge to come up with a brand new answer to an specific situation.

# Hope you enjoy this repo.
